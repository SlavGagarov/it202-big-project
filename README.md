This project uses a pokemon database to populate a list where the user can choose what pokemon information they want to see.
The Second screen of the application shows the stats of that pokemon, the user has to hit the "GO" button on the homescreen in order for screen 2 to update.
The Third screen of the app shows the stored search history that is in the database.
The app also uses the user's locaton and displays weather data for his/her location.
